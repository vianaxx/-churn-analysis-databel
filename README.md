# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Analysis â€“ Power BI Case Study (DataCamp)

This project was developed as part of the **"Reducing Customer Churn in Power BI"** case study on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). The objective is to apply real-world Power BI skills to analyze the customer churn rate of a fictional telecom company called **Databel**.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. This project aims to answer key business questions such as:

- What is Databel's current churn rate?
- Why are customers churning?
- Which customer segments are more likely to cancel?
- How can churn be reduced through data-driven insights?

## ðŸ§  What Was Developed

- Custom **calculated columns** and **DAX measures** to support deep analysis.
- Creation of visually engaging, interactive report pages in Power BI.
- Use of **dynamic filters** and slicers to explore dimensions such as contract type, payment method, tenure, and more.
- Clear visual identification of high-risk segments for customer loss.
